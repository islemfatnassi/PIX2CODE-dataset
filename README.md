# 🧩 PIX2CODE Web Dataset

This repository contains a custom dataset prepared from the [pix2code](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code) project.  
It focuses specifically on **web-based (HTML/CSS) interfaces**, extracted and organized for further experimentation or model training.

## 📁 Contents

- `all_data/` – Collection of web interface screenshots and their corresponding code snippets
- Dataset mainly focuses on **HTML/CSS web UIs**
- Useful for tasks like code generation from images (image-to-code)

## 🛠️ My Work

- Extracted and cleaned dataset focused on the web part only
- Prepared it to be used for machine learning tasks
- Part of my experimentation on UI understanding
